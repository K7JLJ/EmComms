**QUESTION :** If you had to pick an HT (Handi-Talkie) for your "Tactical Comms" radio in a grid-down scenario, what would it look like feature wise?

Based off a perceived need for comms security and the need to monitor signals in my immediate area during such a time I would want the following items in an HT System. I say system because one needs to look outside the normal criteria to address the grid-down issue.

## SHTF EMCOMM HT MUST HAVE FEATURES

### 1. Dual-Band VHF/UHF

It's got to be able to be used with a cross-band repeater, period. A dual-band repeater is such a "tactical" EmComms multiplier that it's a non-starter to consider a single band radio.

### 2. External power source capability

Must have built in 12VDC charging circuit for the battery. HTs that only have a cradle or charge at any other voltage source other than 12VDC are not suited for extended field use.

Taking an extra battery is a great idea and my first choice, but Plan_B needs to include a way of recharging in the field be it from a car battery or solar panel directly.

### 3. Semi-Secure Comms

When I say "secure" I mean not easily heard by Bubba's Raiders with their $20.00 Baofeng UV-5R radio on scan mode.

The **first level** of semi-secure comms would be simple [voice inversion](https://youtu.be/xsy1KKuF6rM) like many China radios (TYT-UVF1) offer. It's might be considered illegal to use by some, but then so are most of those Chinese radios everyone is buying for preparedness that are not rated for the HAM bands.  This is actually not as available as it was 10 years ago and unless you have a matched pair of HTs with this feature, it's not my first choice as even then, many times it does not work 100% on encode/decode.

> I'll let you in on a secretâ€¦ the FCC isn't coming to hunt you down for minor violations in the good times let alone the bad.

The **second level** would be using a DMR (Digital Mode Radio) like the [TYT MD-380](https://www.amazon.com/TYT-MD-380-Moto-TRBO-Radio/dp/B00X6FYWWS) to easily knock out 99% of all that might be listening in.

Most non-HAMs are not going to pay over $100.00 for a radio when they can get (4) $25.00 Baofengs for the same price and "check the box" on their prepping gear list of items stored away.  But they might buy a $25.00 SDR dongle to receive signals around them, but are not likely to invest the time and effort to learn how to decode that DMR signal with free SDRPlay software anyway so the DMR option is pretty secure for the most part.  Now that cheap Chineese radios are in the DMR realm and lower cost bracket, it's not as obscure as before.

### 4. Ability to use low output

Having a radio that will output down to 0.5W or less means longer battery life and added security by a decreased footprint of your signal.  If they can't hear your, they can't find you.

The HAM creed (LOL) to use only enough power to "make the trip" will never be more important as when the grid is down and electronic signals are reduced to a trickle compared to the flood waters we navigate each day in a wireless world.

The candle is a bright light when there is only darkness surrounding it and your simplex signal will stand out to anyone listening as the noise floor drops to nothing. 

### 5. Weather proofing

While I would like for my radios to all be [IP65](http://www.dsmt.com/resources/ip-rating-chart/)+, it's not a deal breaker if it's only able to handle a little moisture like IP53 that should handle a light drizzle until you can put it in a [wetbag](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075V5BC2C/_encoding=UTF8?coliid=I2Q7XP9C20FQOW&colid=1Y5Y105WDR8FD).

### 6. Ruggedness

A brand that is known for making quality radios with a proven track record.

### 7. Scanning ability

The ability to monitor FRS/GMRS EMS and Commercial freqs is a must. A wide band receiver and fast scan mode are preferred. While nothing compares to a dedicated scanner like the Uniden Bearcat 125XL, there is a huge difference in speed between cheap HT's and quality HT's!

## I present to you the Yeasu FT-70DR!

Like most quality dual-banders, the FT-70DR covers the majority of the criteria listed above and unique to only a few HTs on the market, it also handles digital comms for added security, but Yeasu goes above the rest.

The one thing the FT-70DR does that no other radio does, is allow a non-HAM to know which mode is being used instantly at a glance (BLUE/ORN LEDs) and not have to change settings to convert between DMR and Analog.

It can be set to switch modes to match the received signal without any input from the OP. Huge advantage when used by someone that is not as radio savvy as yourself.

Not only that, but you can program it to transmit on Digital each time instead of the default mode of transmitting on the last received mode. Helps to keep OPSEC for those not use to doing so.

There are other HTs that will work on DMR and Analog, but Yaesu has hit the perfect blend with this model IMO, allowing DMR security and the ability to communicate with analog users in Simplex as well as Cross-band repeater mode at a bargain price.

While most will use the FT-70DR as a starter radio for FUSION systems, I believe the Prepping Community is missing the value of the FT-70DR as a semi-secure and capable HT for immediate AO Simplex EmComms.

## Features I Like about the FT70-DR

Some features about the radio that tend to annoy HAMs, I consider pluses for my intended use. Like the fact that it **does not have an internal GPS** to send coordinates over FUSION.

If I want to send my location it will be over the air as a predetermined checkpoint or using [[Analog TX Encoding]].  I don't want the temptation to send it the easy (unsecured) way to be there or accidentally be in beacon mode with the built in GPS and not know it.

Another feature I see complaints about is the fact that you **have to hold a button on the side while turning the radio volume up or down**.  I personally love this "feature" as I don't have to worry about a knob spinning the volume up/dn while I'm walking about.

One thing I really liked about my Yeasu VX-6R was how easy it was to program off the face plate. The FT-70DR is also **very easy to program off the face plate**, but if you have to program a hundred channels into the radio, **[CHIRP](https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home) is available for it for free** and it works on Linux!

As I mentioned, the default setting is to transmit on the mode that was last received, but you **can manually set your outgoing traffic to be digital mode only** if you like with a few keystrokes on the number pad. This keeps your transmissions a bit more secure from analog users.

My default configuration is to talk on digital mode simplex and scan analog but by getting the MARS mod done from [Gigaparts.com](http://Gigaparts.com) I also can communicate to any radio in the spectrum be it a blister-pack FRS/GMRS/MURS, or analog HAM radio I hear on the air.

If there is one HT I would recommend over all, the Yaesu 70-DR is the one.  It's a very under valued HT that many do not consider because most that purchase digital HTs do so for the internet connectivity that DMR/Fusion provide and DMR is the VHF of radio and Fusion the BlueRay that will likely fade out eventually.  

For Simplex the less popular mode is the one I want if security through obscurity is the goal.
