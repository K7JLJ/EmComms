Below is my field repair kit that I not only use in the field, but at home also.  The best way to know if you have everything you need is to ONLY work out of the kit so you can discover any short comings of it.  

I've been using this kit for the past 8 months and it has not failed to complete the task with the exception of the soldiering pen, I had to re-flow some circuits on my [[(tr)uSDX]] and used a professional grade 700F Miller unit at work instead.  Could I have done it with the USB unit below?  Yes, but it would have been a temporary fix and one that took 3x longer.

I suggest putting a kit like this in your field bag, better to have it and not need it then to not have it and need it!
