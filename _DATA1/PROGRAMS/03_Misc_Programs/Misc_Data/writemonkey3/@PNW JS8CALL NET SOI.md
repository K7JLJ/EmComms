#### @PNW JS8CALL NET SOI
last updated: 20240329:1722z

This document is probably as close to an SOI as I will get when it comes to the net and will be updated on occasion and resent to subscribers upon any major changes, please check back on occasion if you are a participant of the net.

Any sharing of the net should point to (https://pnwminuteman.com/s/pnw-js8call-net)  while the Internet is up or by using your CQCQCQ function in JS8Call to advertise as described in the JS8SPOTTER SETTINGS document.  

#### THE NETS PURPOSE
This net is about passing traffic in a fast and orderly way in austere conditions. 

The NETFLOW DOCUMENT should make it pretty simple to do with anyone in the role of NCS if everyone is on the same page as to what to do and when to do it during an on-air net.

The point is to gather as much information possible in a small COMMS WINDOW when the grid is down and normal means are not available, on a nightly basis if possible.  

The efficiency of how that is done is determined by how much practice is put into the effort BEFORE an event.  

##### NET USE SCENARIO:
The USA grid has been taken down by a hostile state actor with no ETA on of it coming back.  

If it's determined that it was done by EMP (or if the scenario is a CME) you do not want to leave your comms gear outside of a Faraday Cage except for a very short time to gather intel.  

Any equipment left up, connected, and running will possibly be destroyed if an EMP/CME event happens, having a backup system stored in a Faraday Cage is your best bet to ensuring you will have comms after such and event.  

We will likely all be using our "field portable" rigs after an event has fried our normal stations as I'm guessing 99% of HAMS leave their station up all the time or at least connected to their antenna which will carry destructive voltage during an EMP/CME event. 

> The likelihood of a follow-up EMP is not out of the question and if you are not caging your gear outside of the COMMS WINDOW you might lose you backup system also.

At a minimum I suggest you turn the rig off and use a manual antenna selector to disconnect it from the radio when not in use. I also suggest staying proficient with your "field portable" rig and practice with it every 3 months at the least.

So, a short COMMS WINDOW is in your interest and having pre-loaded information to pass or have retrieved by NCS and disseminated to the group is crucial!  

> The COMMS WINDOW should be no longer than 30 minutes (0200z-0230z).


#### SPREADING THE WORD
Going to the "watering holes" of JS8Call (7078,14078, etc) and pushing a CQCCQCQ with the nets info every once and a while is a good way to bring curious operators over. 

Just DON'T SPAM the air waves please.  

My CQCQCQ field looks like this: 

> CQCQCQ PNW NET - HTTPS://PNWMINUTEMAN.COM/S/PNW-JS8CALL-NET OR SEND "E? PNWNET" FOR MORE INFO ON-AIR.

#### NET MEETING TIMES / FREQS
[Nightly 0200z 7.090MHz] 

Nets are scheduled for every night, but that doesn't mean someone will be on-air.  Just like you would expect in SHTF, you don't know until you listen in if anyone is on station.  

If I (K7JLJ) cannot be on-air to run the net, I will at least try to leave my radio "on station" with a message to pass on from my STATUS field during net times so others can practice pulling that information from an unattended station.  I encourage all that participate to do this if not able to be at their radio during the net.  

If I'm not on-air to be NCS, anyone can assume that role by using the NETFLOW DOCUMENT to conduct the net with cut & paste messages sent to @PNW. First one to step up to the "mic" is the designated NCS for the night.


#### GENERAL NET RULES:
All traffic is sent to @PNW, not individuals or the NCS. This way stations that can't hear NCS can follow traffic and those unattended stations will have messages stored in their JS8Call "Directed" center window to retrieve later.

#### ALL TRAFFIC TO SEND IS ENTERED IN THE "STATUS" EXPECT FIELD.
Keep it short and sweet, this ensures the most important traffic is passed ASAP at the beginning of the net, more information can be exchanged (conditions permitting) at the end of the net but the point of a nightly net is to get nationwide intel in a timely manner WITHOUT having to spend an hour on the radio "ragchewing" to accomplish that goal.

The ability to pre-load a message for the net into your STATUS field to be disseminated by the NCS to the @PNW group is the key feature of this net protocol.

The AmRRON STATREP is sent first then any news preceded by the date/time of when it was made known to you.

> example: A OR H 20240322:1800z TROOPS SEEN MOVING NORTH ON INTERSTATE-5 20240312:0200z MARTIAL LAW DECLARED IN OREGON.

If you have nothing to report, just send your AmRRON STATREP in short form.

> example: A OR M	= Normal Oregon Mobile
