>‘Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools because they have to say something.’ – Unknown

It might be a phase for me but thus is life,  this year (2025) I felt obligated to move to a simpler way of doing things by switching to a GrapheneOS privacy phone , reading more [Scriptures](https://www.cepher.net) and being less consumed with distractions in my day-2-day life. 

Of coarse building a simpler website, the one you see before you, was also a part of all that.

Posts will be at a slow-ish pace as my intent is to be very thorough so that a working understanding of the topics will be imparted by each article making them worth the wait.  

I want people to be able to accomplish the goals of each article with nothing but the information found on one page. Meaning all the necessary background information is covered besides the main focus of the article.

That is the goal at least, I hope you will join me here and on the air to work on better comms for uncertain times to come.  If you are a JS8Call or VarAC operator, you can find me on 7.092 or 7.078 most days, just use my call or @PNW to reach out.  

The @PNW JS8Call Group was a "Pacific NorthWest" net idea from my old website that I would like to revive eventually as a efficient way of transferring information for the region in SHTF, look for a post on the topic soon.
