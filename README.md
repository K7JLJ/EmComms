>‘Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools because they have to say something.’ – Unknown

It might be a phase for me but thus is life,  this year (2025) I felt obligated to move to a simpler way of doing things by switching to a GrapheneOS privacy phone , reading more [Scriptures](https://www.cepher.net) and being less consumed with distractions in my day-2-day life. 

Of coarse building a simpler website, the one you see before you, was also a part of all that.  I started with Obsidian Publish but have moved to github and simple markdown as it's free and without ads.

I hope you will join me here and on the air to work on better comms for uncertain times to come.  If you are a JS8Call or VarAC operator, you can find me on 7.092 or 7.078 most days, just use my call or [@PNW](https://github.com/K7JLJ/EmComms/blob/main/JS8Call%20%40PNW%20Rolling%20Net.md) to reach out.  

The [@PNW JS8Call Group](https://github.com/K7JLJ/EmComms/blob/main/JS8Call%20%40PNW%20Rolling%20Net.md) was a "Pacific NorthWest" net idea from my old website that I would like to revive eventually as a efficient way of transferring information for the region in SHTF I hope you will check out it out and participate.
