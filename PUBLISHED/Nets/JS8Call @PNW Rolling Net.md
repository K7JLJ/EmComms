# ==PLEASE DO NOT JOIN US!==
If you are not going to use your STATUS AND INFO expects to pass traffic as described below of which is the core mechanism for this net,  *** PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE *** do not add the @PNW group to your station as it just wastes time for those in the group when they send queries to @PNW and your station responds with default information like "Antenna, Radio, JS8Call Version, etc." instead of using them for passing traffic.

## JS8Call @PNW Rolling Net
Last year (2024) [Drew KG7YSX](https://www.youtube.com/@TerminalElement) and myself started experimenting with a simple but effective means of gathering and sharing information via JS8Call that eventually evolved into the protocol I will describe here.

## Keep It Simple Stupid
We both have been part of groups that tend to want to over complicate things when it comes to JS8Call, usually trying to run nets using the software like it was FLDigi or a voice net with an NCS orchestrating the show.

The beauty of this program is not just it's superb efficiency, making one of the best "weak signals" software packages out there, but the built in tools that allow for unattended transfer of information.  Something that should be capitalized on with a protocol like the one being presented here.

The key to true "EmComms" or communicating in an Emergency if you yourself are the one in the effected zone, is to be able to have information available to go out and be received 24/7 **WITHOUT** having to be at the radio.  If you are in the "thick of it", you have other important things to be doing than standing by on the radio.

## JS8Call Always Ready
By using the built in "expects" (as in we expect and answer if we send a query) of **STATUS** and **INFO**, we can deliver our status and any information we need to send to anyone asking our station or @Group in JS8Call, specifically @PNW in this case.  

Using **STATUS / INFO** for pertinent information seems like a lot better use of these "expects" than the standard "Antenna, Radio, JS8Call Version, etc." stuff that most people keep in there. 

## A Better Use JS8Call's Built In Expects:
>INFO = CN83 MAR09: PWR OUT, SNOW STORM CN81 MAR07: I5 SHUTDOWN BOTH DIR

>STATUS = CN83 MAR09: YELLOW

Two simple lines like the above example lets people in your group (@PNW in our case) know your status as of MAR 9th and recent news items from the week.  Like Interstate-5 being closed in both directions since MAR07 and the power being out since MAR09.

The important part is identifying the GRID and DATE of each news item but also to keep the <u>overall message short</u> enough to guarantee decode in poor conditions.

## Net Times
The Net time is 1 hour to be on station for late comers and during SHTF the idea is to keep your station up 24/7 on 7.078 to allow PUSH/PULL of info via the built in STATUS and INFO "expects", ==JS8Spotter is not needed to participate==.

>You don't have to wait for the weekly net time to PUSH/PULL information from STATUS/INFO either, you should be updating as things change and daily (if possible) in an emergency.  

>The Net time is just for those who can't maintain a persistent presence.

Because we jump around the bands (I personally am on 7092 90% of the time) having a known place and time to meet is good.  For this I propose a net time is established.

### 7092 Sundays 1800-1900PST.

For those who can not be on station 24/7 this is the dedicated "come up" time and freqto check-in and retrieve information.  

My personal SOP is to run on 7092 everyday of the week, usually persistent 24/7.  You can PUSH / PULL to my station on 7092 anytime.

## Off-Grid Sharing

By sending ==E? PNW== on 7.092 my station will respond with the following which summarizes this page:
### E? PNW
>@PNW IS A ROLLING NET - TINYURL.COM/K7JLJ FOR INFO. OR SEND E? PNW2 FOR PARTS 2-5

#### E? PNW2
>@PNW CAN BE FOUND ON 7092 ALMOST 24/7 SEND E? PNW3 FOR MORE

#### E? PNW3
>@PNW ALL TRAF TO PASS SHOULD BE STORED IN YOUR STATIONS INFO EXPECT AND YOUR STATUS IN ITS EXPECT. SEND E? PNW4 FOR MORE

#### E? PNW4
>@PNW FORMATS: INFO = (GRID MMMDD TRAFFIC), STATUS (GRID MMMDD CONDITION GREEN/YELLOW/RED) SEND E? PNW5 FOR MORE

#### E? PNW5
>@PNW THIS INFO CAN BE PULLED OR PUSHED TO THE GROUP AT ANYTIME DURING A CRISIS. YOU SHOULD MAKE A HABIT OUT OF UPDATING THESE EXPECTS WHEN YOU HAVE COMMS UP.

### Spreading The Word
You can help by pointing people to this page and/or setting up the ==E? PNW== expects above in JS8Spotter also.

### Online Telegram Group
I also have a Telegram Group setup if you have questions or suggestions, you can join with this link: https://t.me/+MdfOaMzu5Jc5MDMx

### Email
If you have questions or suggestions, please email them to me at jim@k7jlj.com.

## VarAC Too
My station runs VarAC with JS8Call at all times if you have the mode and want to experiment with a faster file sharing mode that compliments JS8Call well.
