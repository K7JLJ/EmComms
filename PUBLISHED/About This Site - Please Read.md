>‘Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools because they have to say something.’ – Unknown

It might be a phase for me but thus is life,  this year (2025) I felt obligated to move to a simpler way of doing things by switching to a [[GrapheneOS]] privacy phone , reading more [Scriptures](https://www.cepher.net) and being less consumed with distractions in my day-2-day life. 

Of coarse building a simpler website, the one you see before you, was also a part of all that.

Articles will be posted at a slow-ish pace as my intent is to be very thorough so that a working understanding of the topics will be imparted by each article making them worth the wait.  

All topic info will be kept to one post whenever possible and most added in increments, so be sure to check the [Site Change Log](Site%20Change%20Log.md) to know when that happens.  Each page also has it's own Change Log at the bottom.

I want people to be able to accomplish the goals of each article with nothing but the information found on one page. Meaning all the necessary background information is covered besides the main focus of the article.

That is the goal at least, I hope you will join me here and on the air to work on better comms for uncertain times to come.  If you are a JS8Call or VarAC operator, you can find me on 7.092 or 7.078 most days, just use my call or @PNW to reach out.  

The @PNW JS8Call Group was a "Pacific NorthWest" net idea from my old website that I would like to revive eventually as a efficient way of transferring information for the region in SHTF, look for a post on the topic soon.

## Worthy of Its Hire

This site is being published via [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) which cost $8.00 a month, and adds nothing to my needs other than I like to write and share my experience as my outlet.

$100.00 per year is a little steeper than I would like but the native publishing option is seamless and in the past I've found it to be the best way to host online.

I'm going to pay for the first year and then provide a [Venmo](https://account.venmo.com/u/K7JLJ) link to collect donations from readers for next years hosting fee. The progress of which will be recorded below. If we make the fee amount by next year the site will be renewed, if not, then it was not worth keeping up and the people have spoken. ;-)

### FEB 2026 Website Host Funding

| Target = $96.00 | ==Funded = $20.== | Chip in with: [Venmo](https://account.venmo.com/u/K7JLJ) |

### Personalized Help Group
> One benefit of donating will be an invite to the =="K7JLJ Support" Telegram Group== (send request to @Jim_K7JLJ on TG) with the ability to message me directly for clarifications or help on anything radio related that you might want to cover, licensed or not. I'm not a GURU, just a guy making HAM Radio work for me, if you find anything here worth a $1 - $5 donation to the hosting fund it is much appreciated!

Like I say... "I'm a Prepper with a radio." I've been a General Class ([K7JLJ](https://www.hamqth.com/K7JLJ)) amateur licensed operator since 2016 and 99% of my radio experience is Digital Modes, my hope is that you will stick around and find something of value here.
