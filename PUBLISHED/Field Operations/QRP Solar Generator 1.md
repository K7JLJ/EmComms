## My SLAB Generator 
Circa 2019, still in use.

While it's not stylish to use SLAB batteries these days for HAM Radio power, they are still an important part of my system for several reasons.

1. Affordability  
2. Abuse tolerant  
3. Easy to find in SHTF 
4. Most likely to find a charger for in SHTF  

The only downside is they are heavy for their power units (this unit is ~11lbs) and have only a 50% discharge rate, so the combined 18aH supply is effectively only 9aH in use.

One big reason I use them is also that I get them **FREE** from work.  The picture below is a drawer component of a rack mounted UPS system common to Ethernet rack mounted hubs throughout my workplace.

They are 2S2P 12vdc 9aH batteries that usually have one cell that becomes unbalanced and so the whole tray is replaced.  Lucky for me, the other (3) batteries are usually in great shape!

When I was trying to figure out which enclosure to build the Solar Generator in, I laid two of these [HR 1234W F2](https://amzn.to/446WTOr) batteries into a [Pelican 1170](https://amzn.to/3Rxv9Lf) or a cheaper [MEIJIA](https://amzn.to/42nh6hB) and they **FIT PERFECTLY**, I mean no movement at all!

I decided to try out a new charge controller because I had planned on putting a waterproof one on top of the Pelican case, but when it arrived it was way smaller than the pictures on Amazon.com made me think.  

Instead of going on the outside of the case,  I was able to fit it inside... perfect!

All wires are connected with Anderson Powerpoles, and only one (1) need be removed from the multiplier block to completely isolate the batteries for storage.  

With an extra opening on the quad block, I can add on more load to the batteries if needed also.

The output of the charge controller feeds the back RED/BLK connections and regulates load with a:

Discharge Stop Voltage:  11.2V  
Discharge Reconnect Voltage:  12.6V

The front voltage display is connected directly to the battery to remind me to disconnect completely when not in use.

I can charge the battery via vehicle with a cigarette lighter by plugging into the output terminal or multiplier block.  The yellow connections are for the solar input using my 30W Powerfilm fold up solar panel or other panels.  The Powerfilm is always with the FT-817.

Twin SLABs make for an undesirable setup in the field due to weight and lower DOD than LifePO4s provide.

While it has it's use and is affordable when using free batteries, I have moved to a LifePO4 setup for field use these days and this setup serves as a "UPS backup" for the base radio using a [Western Mountain Radio PWRGate](https://amzn.to/3RrlgyM) for when there is a power loss.

The PWRGate is seamless in transferring to backup power and can run 40A without issue.

While I'm rebuilding my HAM Shack solar system, it's been a good piece of mind knowing if "shore power" drops while the radio is up it's not going to affect it.  We get a lot of power bumps where we live.

This setup can also serve as a handout system to charge lights, etc. for those who have nothing.  It's simple and effectiveness has kept it around for the past 6 years and will likely continue to be used well into the future.
