Below is my account of a major snow storm that took place six years ago with some hindsight added in. At the bottom is changes made to my system since 2019.

No power in the Winter months made for a great test that while a bit uncomfortable, was not horrific and I suspect with the improvements I have made since then, would be even easier to ride out in comfort.

Below is some stuff I wrote down during the first week concerning my comms plan and how to address some short comings I found.

### 02.24.19 Sunday @ 1930  
It's been 18 hours or so without power.   For something to do, I started writing this post and would add to it over the days to come as I noticed short-comings in our comms plan.

### 02.24.19 Monday
12" of snow on the ground.  The dirt road we live on no longer passable and everyone on it was socked in.  Monday night after having got the road cleared out, thankfully we have a construction company at the top of our hill that maintains the road for the community and keeps a large CAT tractor up there, another 6-8" of snow fell, blocking me in again and keeping me from going to work on Tuesday morning.

### 02.25.19 Tuesday
Tuesday afternoon I was able to get the truck out of the driveway and head to town.

### 02.27.19 Wednesday
Governor [declares emergency](https://web.archive.org/web/20190228064703/https://www.kdrv.com/content/news/Pummeled-by-Storms-Douglas-County-Declares-State-of-Emergency-506467281.html). 

### 03.02.19 Sunday (1 week without power)
A week later It is the worst snow storm in the region ever recorded and the resulting power outages have lasted 7 days so far for my location. 

![map](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ob5c700ilcpejan/power_map.jpg?raw=1)

Then the power company sent out the notice above that we were to expect delays for another 2 weeks in restoration, fortunately a local home owner on our road had a huge CAT dosser that he cleared a trail to a broken power pole so the utilities could get their rig in to replace it with, saving us two more weeks without power.  The power would be restored 2 days after the announcement instead of two weeks.

## Radio Silence  
Because it was a local outage (Douglas County mostly, some of Lane County), I expected to hear someone talking about it on the [OEN](http://www.w7oen.net/oen.htm)  (Oregon Emergency Net, 3980) but did not.  

Not even during the 1800 nightly net check-in.  There was a noticeable difference in how many were checking in early and on E-Power.  

Just goes to show that a huge net like that barely has time to get everyone (700+ members in Oregon Alone, with ~100 checking in nightly) logged before conditions fade.  Forget about passing on non-emergent info like conditions throughout the region.

### Oregon's Professional VHL Solution
The state VHF repeater system [W7PRA](https://www.w7pra.com) is a great system that links many repeaters together throughout all of Oregon.  It allows you to talk to just about anyone with an HT anywhere in the state on VHF.  I believe it's a 100% volunteer system and not state sponsored.  

> Unfortunately, it was down the first night and seemed intermittent the next day.  

I was not able to get "into the box" (the cool way of saying "I could not hit the repeater") from the house with a 5W HT in the house though, so I went out to my truck which has a 50W Kenwood D700 in it.  I was **NOT ABLE** to hit the [W7PRA](https://www.w7pra.com) network with 50W either, which is normally an easy trip even in the hole I live in so I believe it was back down again.

The next day W7PRA was up for good though, which is great news, seeing as it is the easiest way to talk to my wife from work 50 miles away when cell service is out at the house.  

While she has never done anything with her Tech License since getting it with me years back, it does allow her to use the state repeater on VHF, so it's a good thing to have but relying on someone else's infrastructure was shown to not be a good idea in this instance.

### Scanning
Not getting much info from HF and spotty reception in the house via HTs from the VHF repeater network, I turned to the scanner and Douglas County Sheriff's Department dispatch on 155.700 for information gathering.  

Listening to 155.700 in the truck on a Diamond 77 antenna made for easy listening.  In the house though with my old Uniden Bearcat HT Scanner and rubber ducky or hooked to my HF sloper wire, things are pretty choppy!  

One thing I'm for sure changing from this storm experience is to put up a Discone antenna on the roof and likely move the D700 into the shack.   I under estimated the value of VHF information gathering.

This has me wanting to try a VHF Winlink type program to get emails/sms out via VHF/HF also, for things like telling my boss I won't be into work tomorrow and letting family know via text we are OK. 

### The Need For An Off-Grid Comms Group
A major reason why I started the [Off-Grid Comm Group](https://groups.io/g/OffGridComms) (I later handed it over to a group member) was to develop a network that could pass information regionally on a smaller scale, with people able to operate without power for extended periods of time.  

The group site is designed to be a place where like minded people can make contacts in their region and practice emergency comms for such an even like I am writing about here.  

> Such a group would have been great to have had in place during the first week for information gathering before the cell phones started working again.

Unfortunately it was never ready for prime time and like many things, people got excited about it but then faded out.  I was going to delete it but a member asked me not to and he took over as Admin for the group, but looking at the traffic today on the group, you can see it's deader than a door knob.

### @PNW Is Now That Group
The JS8Call group @PNW is my current attempt to create a information network and is slow going but I have a few solid contacts across the nation that are dedicated HAMs that belong to another higher level group @HRMS which uses more complicated methods of communications but both groups have their purpose and I hope to slowly build the [[JS8Call @PNW Rolling Net]] up in the next year or so.

## The Power Struggle 
My main shack solar batteries were **DEAD** at the start of outage!  This was a combination of not enough solar panels (Winter sun is horrible in the PNW), old batteries, and poor maintenance.  

I had just enough power for calling from the 100W TT-599 when bypassing the MCR for ~6hrs, then batteries went to low for non-emergency use.  The only reason I could do this is the TGE N8XJK Booster I had in the shack that maintains 13.8v even when the input is at normal shutoff levels.  This unit has since failed so that option is not available anymore. 

> I have learned the hard way that you can't just throw some old RV batts in a box and hope for the best when it comes to solar.   

A major upgrade is coming in this department!  I've already talked the wife into expanding the battery box outside and bringing the charge controller, etc. into the HAM Shack on the wall.  This will get the inverter out of the cold also and keep all electronics inside.

==This was later done as well as adding protection relays inside the house for the battery bank outside.==

When we discovered that her sewing machine only takes 0.66 amps, and the new system could handle that easily if we did the upgrade, it was a done deal! :)

### Last Ditch
When the main solar batteries went down, I had to switch to a backup 12aH SLAB and run my FT-817 QRP rig instead of the Ten-Tec Eagle.  

A QRP rig is a must for long term SHTF as they draw nothing in power and power is a premium when all you have is what you can generate yourself.  Without a solid solar setup or multiples, you are done for in short order.  This little 12aH also was used to power the scanner and charge phones, until it  died eventually.  

I did make it to work (50 miles away) one day of the first week and brought my charging unit to top the 12aH SLAB off while I was there for 10 hours.  But that's not an option when the grid is truly down.

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z02zxxcsv3lzq3g/1551646350206522.jpg?raw=1)  
The next day the main solar system had charged up enough to switch back over, but I had to limit the use of my 100W Ten-Tec Eagle severely and limit transmissions to 25W.

![ft817_latern](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e1g9a5y5yrsttur/1551646350337375.jpg?raw=1)
My DIY 2P3S 16850 cell 11.4vdc battery kept the QRP FT-718 rig powered for emergency use when shack was power down, the main solar system recharging individual cells in the Nitecore i4 charger.  This was my last resort to keep comms up and would be sustainable I believe with minimal station on times, coming up on freq for the daily voice net.

==I had no JS8Call running in 2019, so powering a laptop was not a consideration.  Powering a laptop is a bigger challenge than a QRP radio and keeping a station up and running 24/7 on only the power I can create is a bigger challenge.==

## Update: 10.30.2021  
Two years latter and how have I done on my To Do list?   
-  I struck through all items that were done.   
-  will be adding "work on radio book" today to my list of things to get done
-  `items that I decided against`  

There are a few other areas I will be looking to shore up, but the big one is to put a serious effort into a quality solar setup and battery maintenance regiment.  Below are a few quick notes to follow up on  also.

**TO DO:**  
- ~~Printout [[OSP 12-Codes]] and pre-programmed channels on radios.~~
- ~~Printout W7PRA Freqs~~ 
- ~~Printout calling freqs & HF nets, add to comms book.~~
- ~~Printout scanner freqs.~~ 
- ~~Move D700 to shack for VHF / Scanner use and add Discone antenna.~~ 
- ~~Start a solar battery PM regime.~~  
- ~~Switch to an MPPT charger system~~  
- ~~Check out CommsPreppers videos I skimmed over before, thinking he was going overboard, LOL!~~ 
- -~~Move solar controls inside house, make room for more batteries outside house.~~  
- `Finish FT-817 "Go-Box" and program base repeater info as well as setup Repeaterbook control via Bluetooth.`

**BUY:**   
- ~~Another 12aH SLAB for in the house and keep charged off of grid power, using my PWRgate PG40S.  Will allow true UPS for 12hrs.~~
- ~~(3) More 100W panels to max solar potential on existing system.~~  
- ~~Replace batteries with (4) 6V - 125aH batts in 2S2P for 250aH @ 12V~~  
- Battery load tester.   
- ~~Mobile antenna for FT-817~~  
- `Bluetooth 38400 baud CAT unit for FT-817`

## 6 Years Later
04.05.2025
Below is a 30,000 ft overview of my current system showing the major changes to my comms plan.

### JS8Call
Today, voice is a last ditch mode and JS8Call is the default mode for collecting information via the [[JS8Call @PNW Rolling Net]] and other nets I participate in.

### True QRP Radios
The Ten-Tec 100W 559 radio has been replaced with my [[Yaesu FT-891]] as a base unit, but the true hero of today's system is my first HF radio the [[Yaesu FT-817]] due to it's low power consumption with the [[(tr)uSDX]] as a backup.

### More Solar 
The minimal power source I had during this outage (300W Solar) has several backup sources today including the following:
1. [ECOFLOW DELTA 2 MAX Power Station with Smart Extra Battery, 4096Wh, Solar Generator for Home Backup](https://amzn.to/3E8jBex) $1,499.00 coupled with [2x EcoFlow 400W Rigid Solar Panel](https://us.ecoflow.com/products/400w-rigid-solar-panel?variant=40250363478089) $999.00 for a system price of $2498.00
2. [ECOFLOW RIVER 2 Portable Power Station (80,000mAh), 256Wh LiFePO4 Battery/ 1 Hour Fast Charging](https://amzn.to/41YsNvc) $499.47 and [ECOFLOW 160 Watt Portable Solar Panel for Power Stations]($329.53) $329.53 for a system price of $829.00
3. [Harbor Frieght: THUNDERBOLT SOLAR 100 Watt Amorphous Solar Panel Kit](https://www.harborfreight.com/100-watt-amorphous-solar-panel-kit-63585.html) $150.00

Prices are what I paid in 2022, links are current on Amazon and Harborfreight.

### Creating A Comms Group
No matter what setup you have for off-grid comms, if you have nobody to talk to it really doesn't matter.  Congressional investigations into the the security of the United States Grid have shown for the past 20+ years that we are one cyber attack or HEMP attack away from being in the dark for over a year.  

This is the time HF comms will be the most important IMO, getting regional news when no information is being passed via TV / Radio / Internet like we normally get it.

Forming a group of like minded HAMs that are able to operate weak signal modes indefinitely (ie. have solar) is a major goal for me and the [[JS8Call @PNW Rolling Net]].

### Other Issues Solved
- Off-Grid water collection (15Kgal rain water collection added)
- Off-Grid camera system
- Whole House Generator and fuel for 3 weeks added
