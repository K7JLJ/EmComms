## Obfuscation & Encryption
There are several ways to keep ones traffic from being discerned when transmitting over the airwaves, one being obfuscation, "The chair is against the wall", Obscurity (using unpopular modes) and of course encryption.  

IMO, the ability to hide the meaning of your transmission has an important role in a comms plan.  But the more I've thought about the subject and dabbled in procedures for doing so on HF digital modes, the more difficulty I have picturing a scenario that would require me to encrypt traffic over HF.

When you really think about what would drive you to transmit encrypted messages outside of your immediate AO, you are looking at a condition where the very transmission is likely to be "verboten" and those hunting your signal are very adept at their jobs, will likely zoom in on your signal within minutes if you are not transmitting while vehicle born using NVIS at a minimum.

If our nation ever gets to that kind of "Nazi Germany" control and hunting down signals, I'm <u>not transmitting anything</u> when those in control decide to [outlaw HAM Radio](https://drive.proton.me/urls/HX6J93P8W0#GPzYsMi2C9ng) as the US did during WW2. The way the US is now, they would be the ones triangulating and taking equipment away and that's a best case scenario in the post "Patriot Act" lawlessness of our executive branch.

## Secured Local Comms
The only exception to sending encryption for me would be a "Civil War" scenario or extended "Grid-Down" event that lasted months to years, a true TEOTWAKI event where you are on your own and sending group information such as size, location, abilities, etc. over the airwaves might bring local bad actors to you.

While encryption is a viable option for military and .gov workers today, it has been determined that you must pay to use this feature on air as a civilian.  Encryption <u>is</u> allowed in the business band VHF (150–174 MHz) and UHF (421–470 MHz) if you pay the FCC annually for the use of a frequency.  

Amateur Bands VHF (144–148 MHz) 	UHF (430–440 MHz) are forbidden the use of encryption though, even though you can see they share the same frequencies between UHF (430-440 MHz).  What makes it legal for one operator verses another?  Money paid to a bureaucracy to give you permission.  In the scenario we are talking about, WROL, nobody is going to care, and to be honest, nobody really cares now but no sense in pressing your luck.

## So Why Not Encrypt Now?
Because there is not really a need as the threat level does not require that level of difficulty and when the threat level does, it will be time to stop transmitting anyway.  Time to remove all electronics from your arson and go "old school" low tech.

But in the mean time, there are good alternatives to total message encryption.

## Security Through Obscurity
For me this meant using a digital HT radio that is an uncommon mode in my area.  

That mode is Fusion or C4FM that Yaesu uses in their digital radios, specifically the FT70D that is also an analog radio that switches between modes seamlessly making it the easiest radio to use between digital an analog users.

When I'm not using my FT70D, I have Baofeng AR-152 analog only radios for their humongous batter capacity, unlike the tiny batteries on the FT70D, the AR-152s can run on RX for a week on one battery.  The FT70D will be dead in 10 hours on RX only.

Being analog they are easily listened in on via a standard scanner or $25.00 Baofeng UV5R so a means of obscuring the message is needed.  The method I've chosen is to use an relatively obscure program called Rattlegram on two $26.00 smart phones.  Details are to found in the [Analog TX Encoding](Analog%20TX%20Encoding.md) post.

While I see no need to use encryption at this time, having the means and practicing is a good thing in my opinion.

If you missed the document earlier, I encourage you to read the QST article by N8LUX at https://drive.proton.me/urls/HX6J93P8W0#GPzYsMi2C9ng for an peek into the historical mindset of the government of 1941 and then think about how much more tyrannical the current government is now in comparison.
