### Why not use [AndFlmsg](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fldigi/files/AndFlmsg/) with it's superior abilities?  
```
AndFlmsg is a combination of Fldigi and Flmsg for portable devices
running Android.

The main objective of this development is to provide a low power 
highly-portable, as in mobile or backpack, Flmsg/Fldigi solution. 

Rigs like the Yaesu's FT-817, Icom's 703 and Elecraft's KX3 would
be the typical companions of the Android phone or tablet running 
AndFlmsg, thereby providing a low weight, low energy requirement,
access to most Flmsg services.

The integration of Internet sharing/forwarding makes this solution
attractive as a relay option, possibly a mobile or portable station
in a pertinent geographical location.

The inclusion of modes like MT-63 and long interleave MFSK modes allows
audio coupling to be used effectively without the need for an audio 
interface.

The addition of images and GPS data inclusion opens the usage to 
practical field reporting too.

In a more developed configuration, for example with a 10" tablet 
connected to a Bluetooth or USB keyboard plus mouse, and maybe also
with an audio interface, the operation we get, including data input,
nears the performance and practicality of a laptop configuration but
without the power consumption and cost of the later.
```

### Simply put... lack of popularity and simplicity.  
AndFlmsg is easily decoded via the FLDigi Suite which the MOST popular digital mode freeware available.  Rattlegram is only available for Android/iOS which eliminates 99.9% of those who might listen in.

Another aspect of Rattlegram is that it uses audio coupling (put mic to phone) and does very well at decoding with this method. As you will see in my setup below, an audio cable can also be used to allow VOX TX without any exterior noise to be heard in the field.

### My Rattlegram Advice
While it has a lot of features like using the "ultrasonic spectrum" that only a dog can hear, it's best to leave it at it's FACTORY RESET settings out of the box.  You start messing with settings and it becomes unreliable IMO and there is no need to change them.

## My Hardware

The setup above includes:
-  **Used Android Phone**
	- I went with the cheapest model on eBay I could find, a [Motorola G6](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=motorola+g6&_sacat=0&_from=R40&_sop=15), one was a "pay as you go" model, the other a "Verizon locked" model.  The point is that it doesn't matter as long as they are working and can use Wifi to install the app, and they don't need to be a G6.
