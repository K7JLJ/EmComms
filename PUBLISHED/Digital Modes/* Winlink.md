I remember watching the video from CommPrepper below over 10 years ago and thinking to myself "why would a prepper even bother with a system that is internet tied?"

In a true SHTF scenario, there would be no infrastructure to allow this and it seems overly complicated to bother with.  I mean, it's a cool trick to send/receive emails from a remote radio station over HF, but if the USA is "Grid-Down" there is no internet tie to allow for this mode to work.

If you are forced to use Peer-To-Peer (P2P) comms with it because the internet is down also, then there are more effective modes like JS8Call or VarAC that I would prefer to get the message across.

>If you don't own the infrastructure, you can't assume it will be working when you need it!

So, I put Winlink in the corner of my preparedness plan and drove on until recently when Drew KG7YSX convinced me that it does have a purpose in any serious comms plan and got me on board.

Besides the two fun exercises above, Winlink fits into my comms plan on the off chance that the world doesn't go Mad-Max all at once and the infrastructure is still up just outside of my AO.  A likely scenario if the [Big One](https://youtu.be/76b_WGzCI54?feature=shared) ever hits here in the PNW.

What's the most efficient way to communicate any given day of the week?  Email or SMS texting by far.  Winlink lets you do that from your radio when your own internet connection is down.  Even if all the internet is down, some nodes act as mailboxes for simplex connections.  Meaning they transfer your emails to the internet and their final destination when the internet is up, but can also be used between two stations connecting to the same node to pass traffic directly radio to radio when there is no internet.

Establishing which nodes allow for this is something you and your fellow HAMS need to work out before an emergency, but it's an option to consider when the node is in the effected are also.  Mine and Drews main node (callsign here) is one that does this and also a secured / hardened node that might survive more than the average setup.

In reality though, a simplex solution that can handle email size messages like [[* VarAC]] is a better option between radio operators.  Winlink is a better option between a HAM and non-HAM outside of the effected area.  So they both have their place.

### FEMA
One great source of information is the [FEMA Daily Operations Briefing](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSFEMA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USDHSFEMA_153) email list.  Short and sweat in normal times but keeps you updated of emergencies in the USA.  By sending this daily or weekly email to your winlink email, you can have this information available while you are on radio comms only.  I prefer the weekly email so the transmission times are shorter over the radio.
