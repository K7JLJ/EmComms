## Why JS8Call
I was first introduced to JS8Call by watching [Julian OH8STN ](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKMrdrsNkFA7smIDRFoYEJYFY-0_i-Lto&si=3jDJr9qVp4MPw2EN) on YouTube who recognized it's value as a SHTF mode immediately due to it's built in "mail boxing" features.

It's ability to allow messages to be left and retrieved WITHOUT the need for an operator to be present is crucial to passing traffic when all hell has broken loose. During a grid-down event that reaches outside of the normal regional emergency,  you are not going to have time to sit at your radio trying to retrieve information from HF Nets on a strict schedule to catch up on the news.

JS8Call gives you the ability to come to the HAM Shack at the end of the day or morning and see what traffic has been sent out or stored on your computer should you be a part of an @GROUP in your contacts list.
