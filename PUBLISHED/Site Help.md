## Glossary
Instead of typing out acronyms or less common terms like "Prepper", "FUD", etc... 
I'm going to use the shortened version articles let ya'll look to this page for an explanation. 

>[!faq]- AO
**:** Area of Operations, the immediate area affecting your position.  Home, Property, radius designated area from your base of operations.

>[!faq]- Debloat
**:** to remove unnecessary applications from our devices. Throughout the years, Windows computers and Android phones have been known to include additional applications that are not needed by most people and just waste storage.

>[!faq]- Digital Modes
**:** ... amateur digital communication began in earnest in the late 1940's (if you don't count Morse as a digital mode!) when hams worked out techniques of connecting mechanical Teletype keyboard/printers to amateur gear using FSK and AFSK modulation.

>**:** an old-fashioned, unimaginative, or pompous person

>[!faq]- JOTB
**:** Junk on the Bunk - is a term from the military that describes a detailed inspection of your kit before an operation laid out on your "bunk" (bed) or in the field it would be on your poncho or shelter half back in the day.

>[!faq]- NCS
**:** A formal, or _directed_ net has a single _net control station_ (NCS) that manages its operation for a given session. The NCS operator calls the net to order at its designated start time, periodically calls for participants to join, listens for them to answer (or _check in_) keeps track of the roster of stations for that particular net session, and generally orchestrates the operation of the net.

>[!faq]- OS

>[!faq]- PACE Plan
**:** **Primary, alternate, contingency and emergency** (**PACE**) is a methodology used to build a [communication plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_management "Communications management").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PACE_\(communication_methodology\)#cite_note-1) The method requires the author to determine the different [stakeholders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_stakeholder "Project stakeholder") or parties that need to communicate and then determine, if possible, the best four, different, redundant forms of communication between each of those parties. Ideally, each method will be completely separate and independent of the other systems of communication; failure of any component/process in one should not affect any other means to communicate.

>[!faq]- Prepper
**:** a person who gathers materials and makes plans in preparation for surviving a major disaster or cataclysm (such as worldwide economic collapse or war)

>[!faq]- SHTF
