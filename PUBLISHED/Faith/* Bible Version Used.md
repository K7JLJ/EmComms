Four-letter name of Elohim in the Hebrew Bible

I'm using the KJV off of [BLB.org](https://blb.org) but have substituted LORD (Hebrew YHVH) with Yahuah and God with Elohim as I truly believe that Yahuah is the correct pronunciation of the (4) vowels in Hebrew representing Elohim's name as worn on the priestly garment and recorded by the historian Josephus.

>[Book 5 Chapter 5 Paragraph 7 of Jewish Wars] A mitre also of fine linen encompassed his head, which was tied by a blue ribbon, about which there was another golden crown, in which was engraven the sacred name.  it consists of four vowels.

Once you have seen that the Father's name is not "LORD" and that using such a replacement is a violation of the Third Commandment ([Exo 20:7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/exo/20/7/s_70007)) it is painful to watch it being used in such a way and without explaining why I would use it (for clarification to a non-believer / Christian) each time, I've chosen this route.

For this reason I prefer my [Cepher](http:cepher.net) the only "main stream" version that uses Yahuah.  Some display the translation as Yahwah, which is fairly accurate if sounding out the Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey but even reading versions like the YRB or Hebrew Roots Bible that use "Yahweh" (while a poor translation) is better than a blatant replacement.

Unfortunately, the tools at [BLB.org](https://blb.org) and the Strong's index of the KJV not to mention the universal acceptance of the KJV as a solid translation has me using it here for lack of a digital version of the Cepher online to use.  With a search and replace for the offending "LORD", "God", and "Jesus".  

The Father's name is Yahuah and the Son's name is Yahusha, not Jesus. [Exo 23:20-22]

If all this seems "weird" to you, you should prove it out yourself.  Not just ask your Pastor who teaches you the Sabbath is on Sunday, violating the 4th Commandment.

>[2Ti 2:15 KJV] 15 Study to shew thyself approved unto Elohim, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
