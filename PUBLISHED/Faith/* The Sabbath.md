## A sign between Yahuah and the children of Israel

>[Exo 31:13 KJV] 13 Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep:[^1] for it [is] a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that [ye] may know that I [am] Yahuah that doth sanctify you.

Yahuah only has one people according to his Word.  You will not find "replacement theology", that the blessings of Yah were given to the "Christian church"  because Israel sinned against Elohim.

[Lev 23:32 KJV] 32 It [shall be] unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth [day] of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.

Yah's Sabbath (7th Day) is the sign of a believer in covenant with the creator just as those that keep his commandments [Lev 26] are blessed by Him, verses those who do not and suffer for it.

>[Exo 20:10 KJV] 10 But the seventh day [is] the sabbath of Yahuah thy Elohim: [in it] thou shalt not do any work [^H4399], thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that [is] within thy gates:

>[Deu 5:12-14 KJV] 12 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as Yahuah thy Elohim hath commanded thee. 13 Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work: 14 But the seventh day [is] the sabbath of Yahuah thy Elohim: [in it] thou shalt not do any work [^H4399], thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that [is] within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.

>[Neh 13:19 KJV] 19 And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and [some] of my servants set I at the gates, [that] there should no burden [^H4853] be brought in on the sabbath day.

>[Jer 17:21-22 KJV] 21 Thus saith Yahuah; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden [^H4853] on the sabbath day, nor bring [it] in by the gates of Jerusalem; 22 Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work [^h4399], but hallow [^H6942] ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.
