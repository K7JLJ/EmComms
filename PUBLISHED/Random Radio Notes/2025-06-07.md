### Stuck in a rut?
I belong to a radio group of 15-ish members that operate on JS8Call and has a protocol in place like many other groups to use 20M/40M with primary and backup freqs on both bands.

Knowing primary and secondary bands and freqs that you should be able to find each other on is half the battle, but in reality I'm finding only 2 of the 8-10 active members are even checking 20M.

### Radio only comms
Since yesterday I've been keeping my station on the primary 20M freq and will continue to remain there until upcoming August exercise, if the date gets to me via radio then I will be following the last known SOP.

Even though we have a Discord, I'm forcing myself to not use it and rely on member comms on air only.  I'm one of the 8-10 active members but the only one using radio only at this point.

Can you imagine the task of passing traffic to all 8-10 off-grid?  

Our SOP is in a nice fancy word document, maybe a plain text short and sweet file that can be passed via VarAC is a better option?  These things are not thought or acted upon because we are passing it via the internet instead of poking holes in our setup/SOP by practicing reality.

Using Winlink if only a regional issue works for large info flow, VarAC can take it's place in total grid-down, but only 3 are using it and nothing organized yet.
