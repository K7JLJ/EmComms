For radio work, having an OS like Windows that is constantly phoning home for security updates and data collection from your computer, constantly messing up your sound card configurations after each update and deleting drivers it doesn't like along with installing more spyware is not what I consider a good fit for a computer I just want to use as a utility with my radios for Digital Modes.

Many have chosen the route of Linux as an OS replacement for Windows to overcome this behavior and I admit I also rode the "struggle bus" for a year or so before giving up on "[Linux in the HAM Shack](https://lhspodcast.info/)" totally and returning to Win10.

## Windows Just Works
Unfortunately or fortunately, when it comes to HAM radio programs, Win10 just works out of the box with them and because some programs like VarAC, Ham Radio Deluxe, etc. <b><u>ONLY</u></b> work on Windows, it just makes sense to run it as your HAM Shack OS.  

Now I know some Linux GURU out there is thinking "__it will run under WINE__" but most times these programs __DO NOT__ run under WINE and if they do it's not even close to plug-n-play. Case in point, I tried installing VarAC under WINE with Zorin Linux this week and it failed to start after install. In truth WINE has never worked for HAM Software in my experience.

That doesn't mean it can't be done, it just means that you will spend more time trying to make it work than is worth the trouble in my opinion. If your plan is to become a Linux expert and spend hours and hours combing the internet on how to make a Windows only program run under Linux, than more power to you!  That "anvil" wore this "hammer" out after a year of pounding on it.

I prefer to use an OS that works and get on the air.

## Debloated & Air-Gapped
Windows 10 is actually pleasant to use when it is debloated and <b><u>NEVER</u></b> connected to the internet to create a profile to collect data from.

This is the path I have chosen for my HAM Shack not only because it creates a stable platform to run software on and can not be brought down by malware, but because...

>It gives me the ability to convert any computer (preferably a laptop) I can find into a HAM Shack even if I do not have passwords to it.  Or reinstall on my own hardware offline.

With a copy of the last Windows 10 .iso, some driver files and auxiliary Win10 packet for my Surface Go2 specific hardware, I can, and have, installed Win10 in an Air-Gapped environment several times and have all I need to operate Digital Modes.

A tutorial on how I do this is the next article I plan to write. 

One advantage to using Win10 Air-Gapped is that you can download all the files you need and not be required to go online to get more or update from within an app.  This is huge when the time comes to use radio for real because the internet is taken down.

If you don't have all you need to re-create your HAM Shack for digital modes __TODAY__ you may not get the change nor have the ability to replace what you are running digital modes on currently.  

Considering that one of the likely scenarios for such grid-down scenario is an EMP and while you may have a spare radio put up in a Faraday cage for such a time, do you have an extra laptop also?  I hope so, but if not, having the means to use any computer to run Win10 off of a couple of USB devices off-grid is a huge multiplier IMO.

Linux does not provide an easy way to down load "dependency files" other than creating your own Linux Build that has included them and that's another level above "user" even for the average Linux guy.

## Conclusion
The bare bones of the argument is that an operating system should not be a failure point in your HAM Shack, choose what works instead of working on what you chose.
